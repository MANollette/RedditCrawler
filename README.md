  <strong>This is RedditCrawler, a simple tool for interfacing with the Reddit API and monitoring posts there. </strong>
  
## Concept
This capstone project is being initially designed as a web crawler geared towards Reddit. Its purpose is to take text-based user input, and monitor subs of your choice for posts that match or contain that input. It will then notify you via email and local toast messages. As of 08/07/2019, version 1.0 of the application has been completed, and a release is pending. The application uses your email credentials to send you notification emails when a relevant post is created. If you are not confident in your device's security, you can also run the application without providing these, and it will still provide local toast notifications through the windows runtime. 

To use the application, simply start by running rcConfig, and configure each of your settings in turn, entering your credentials, desired subreddit, and search terms, as well as whether you would like to receive toast notifications or not. Once all of the necessary configurations have been made, the application will notify you that you are ready to run the service. Then, just run RedditCrawler and you're set!
