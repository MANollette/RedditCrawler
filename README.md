# Reddit Crawler
Final BAS capstone project.

## Concept
This capstone project is being initially designed as a web crawler geared towards Reddit. Its purpose is to take text-based user input, and monitor subs of your choice for posts that match or contain that input. It will then notify you via email. The core program I aim to complete is a console application that accepts simple text input to this end. It stores the information on what to scan for and what has already been found in a .txt file, and sends an email on that basis. 

## Extras
Time permitting, I'd like to include the following features by June, in order of priority:
- After setup, application runs in the background as a Windows process. 
- A separate application for editing the input criteria.
- A GUI for both initial setup and later editing.
- A database connection to store the information, rather than a txt file. 
- Support for other websites and data types

The database would be the most ambitious addition to make now, as it would also enable us to save different users.
